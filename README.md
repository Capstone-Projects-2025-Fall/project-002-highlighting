## Keywords

Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.

## Project Abstract

This document proposes an application that aims to replicate the intelligent text prediction found within smartphones into an AAC device. The application will use methods of highlighting to direct the attention of the user of the AAC device. This includes primarily the use of different levels of opacity to draw more attention to specific words that are relevant to the context of conversation. The application will allow the user to use the device's microphone to listen to conversations and highlight relevant words to choose from that best fit the context.

The goal of this application is to give the user a more efficient time to engage in conversation with others using an AAC device, while not limiting or overloading them with word options to choose from.

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
