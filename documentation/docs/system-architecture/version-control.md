# Version Control
Version control will primarily be through **Github** and **git** commands. Branches must be made for every feature that the respective member is working on. Whenever that member is done with the feature it will be put into a merge request where it is **required** that another member must review the code before it can be pushed onto the main branch. 

The main branch is protected by **branch protections** which require approval from a member other then the member who pushed the merge request in order to maintain the main branch remains stable.
