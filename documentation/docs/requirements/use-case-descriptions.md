# Use-case descriptions

## Use Case 1 - Predicting answers
A parent would ask their child a question and the AAC device would pick up the question through audio input (speech to text) and then give the child a display of suggestive options to form a sentence that would function as a relevant response. 
## Use Case 2 - Use context to highlight suggestions
A child could try to form a sentence using the board by having predictive texts given i.e. first word could be choices like pronouns and then the following word could be something like a verb which follows up to another subject.
## Use Case 3 - contextualized prediciting based on relationships 
When a child goes home from school, the AI model will be able to predict words based on who they are speaking to using context from previous conversations and communication styles.
