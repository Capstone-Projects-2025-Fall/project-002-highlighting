# Use-case descriptions

## Use Case 1 - 
A parent would ask their child a question and the AAC device would pick up the question through audio input (speech to text) and then give the child a display of suggestive options to form a sentence that would function as a relevant response. 
## Use Case 2 -
A child could try to form a sentence using the board by having predictive texts given i.e. first word could be choices like pronouns and then the following word could be something like a verb which follows up to another subject.
## Use Case 3 -
When a child goes home from school, the AI model will be able to predict words based on who they are speaking to using context from previous conversations and communication styles.

## Use Case 4 - 
In a classroom with other children and adults several people may be speaking at once and not directly to the child. The user has an option to toggle this microphone on and off. When the microphone is on it will only take input from the most prominent speaker.

## Use Case 5 -
At home, when siblings are playing and one asks “Do you want to play outside?”, the AAC device detects the question and highlights responses like yes, no, maybe later, or outside. This helps the child respond quickly in a natural way without needing to build a full sentence from scratch.
## Use Case 6 -
 During playtime on a tablet or with toys, if someone asks “What do you want to play with?”, the AAC device predicts and highlights relevant options like blocks, car, tablet, or doll. This speeds up the child’s ability to express preferences in the moment.
